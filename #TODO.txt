{Bugs}
^^^^^^
When reloading the admin panel several times the sporadic logoff (sessions get lost) or the page show 500 error.
Because the page uses 3 iframes and loading them causes race conditions with the redisfileclone. If using ram db, not sure.
Added retry mechanism and works beter, but still every now and then the session gets lost, usualy after several rapid refreshes of the page.
Maybe becasue moved to pater web server
